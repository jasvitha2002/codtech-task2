Overview of the project

Project: Grade Tracker System using Python

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

The program is structured using a Python class (GradeTrackerSystem), encapsulating all grade-related functionalities into methods.

**Dictionary Data Structure:**

Grades for each subject are stored in a dictionary (self.grades), where the keys are subjects, and the values are lists of grades.

**Control Structures:**

Conditional statements (if-elif-else) manage user choices and grading logic.
Loops (while) enable continuous interaction with the system until the user chooses to exit.

**Error Handling:**

The try-except block ensures that invalid numeric inputs for grades do not crash the program.

**Input Validation:**

Validates that grades are within the range of 0 to 100.
Ensures the user enters valid menu choices.

**Mathematical Computations:**

Calculates the average of grades using sum() and list operations.
Determines letter grades and GPA based on numeric ranges.

**Dynamic Interaction:**

The program dynamically updates the dictionary as grades are added, and it calculates results on demand.
